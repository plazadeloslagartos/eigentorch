"""
This module implements custom PyTorch Autograd functions which can be used to facilitate weight updating for
Semi-Positive Definite Matrices on a Riemannian Manifold, as opposed to Euclidean Space.  The functions are then used
to define an SPDNet layer.  This is described fully in:

Huang, Z., & Van Gool, L. (2016). A Riemannian Network for SPD Matrix Learning, 2036â€“2042.
